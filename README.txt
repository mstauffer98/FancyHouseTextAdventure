Hello! This is a short text adventure game I made a few years ago. I originally made it for the final
project of a community college class that I took one summer. Of course, it far surpassed what was
necessary for the requirements of the project, so it was more of a personal project than just some
class assignment, to be had. Since the class, I have updated the game through various bug fixes, extra
commands, more dialogue, etc. I believe I have caught all of the major bugs, but some still could
remain. Be welcome to e-mail me if you find any errors.

The game is called "Fancy House" and follows the style of various text adventure - also known as
"interactive fiction" - games such as "Colossal Cave Adventure," "Zork," and "Jigsaw." The best way to
describe these types of games would be to say if a video game is like an interactive movie, then a text
adventure is like an interactive book. The games are second-person-based and the player inputs commands
to perform different actions to interact with the scenes. Examples of commands would be like "look,"
"go east," "examine door," or "take book." There's a total of ten points to find within this game by
accomplishing various tasks. I've had a fun time making the game. And, I'm glad to have created a short
tribute to an underappreciated - though highly influential - genre of gaming. I hope you enjoy it!


Running the Game:
[Note: There are likely better ways to execute the program, but this way has worked for me.
       Also, it works on Windows, but I have not tried it on Mac or Linux operating systems.]
1. Download the project from GitHub.

2. Download the latest version of Java JDK (the lastest .jar file was created in 16.0.2).
   [SEE: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java16]

3. In Windows, open command line (cmd.exe in the Start Menu).

4. Open the directory of the location of the downloaded project using the "cd" command 
   (e.g., cd Downloads).

5. Navigate to the latest version of the game in the folder "FancyHouseTextAdventure"
   (e.g., cd FancyHouseTextAdventure\JDK Version 16.0.2 (latest)).

6. You will need to set "path" to the Java directory bin in the terminal, using the following
   command (The "16.0.2" will vary depending on your version of Java.).:
   set path=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-16.0.2\bin

7. Run the program with the command.:
   java -jar FancyHouseTextAdventure.jar

8. Have fun!
